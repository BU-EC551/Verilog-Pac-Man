                                       The Game
                                  of Life and Death


Developed Fall 2011 by Idan Warsawski, Derek Heyman, Greg Zoeller, and Sergio Shin as a final project in Boston University's ENG EC551: Advanced Digital Design with Verilog

Idea based off the original Pac-Man game, all code, graphics and other assets were created 100% from scratch.

Status
------

Supported Functionality:
 * Smooth movement mimicing the original gameplay
 * Graphics mimicing the original, including having ghosts "look" in the correct direction
 * Eating pellets and incriminating the score
 * Basic Ghost AI (with two separate AI personalities)
 * Collision detection between ghosts and Pac-Man and death animation
 * 2 maps
 * Controlling a ghost as a second player
 * Background effects!

Functionality not supported includes, but is not limited to:
 * Eating ghosts when Pac-Man eats a big pellet (although graphics for this should already be done).
 * Automatically switching maps after finishing the level
 * Bonus items (i.e. fruits)
 * Sound
 * Advanced ghost AI

Implementation
--------------
The target board and FPGA for this project is the xc3s1200, however, it can be configured to run on a smaller xc3s200 by commenting out the background effects module (we were trying to fill up all available BlockRAMs)

The board needs a 50MHz master clock in, 3 bit VGA out and PS/2 in, we were developing on [this](http://www.amazon.com/Digilent-Spartan-3-Board/dp/B005GA8N9E/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1331152052&sr=1-8) board but with a xc3s1200 instead of the 200.

Resynthesizing many of the BlockRAMs may not work due to directory name issues. All coe files are located in the coe_files directory.

Usage
-----

Plug in a VGA monitor and a PS/2 keyboard. The controls are as follows:
 * Up/Down/Left/Right: Control Pac-Man
 * Escape: Stop Pac-Man motion
 * 1, 2: Enable some background effects
 * 3, 4: Switch between the two maps. Note that this will reset all dots eaten
 * 9,0,-,=: More effects, namely some images we loaded in to try and fill up the available BlockRAMs

 * F1,F2,F3,F4: Enable Ghosts 1-4 AI Control
 * F5,F6,F7,F8: Disable Ghosts 1-4 AI Control

When Ghost 1's AI is disabled:
 * I, J, K, L: Control Ghost 1 movement Manually

Additional Notes
----------------
Note that this was developed in approximately two weeks in a very unstructured incremental design process. Best practices, comments and code clarity were sacrificed to try and fit as much functionality as possible during the short time we had to develop this. Additional design documents detailing approaches we took are not uploaded here in the consideration of space.

There is some left over Chip-Scope debugging available. If you have Chip-Scope you can probably poke around a bit and play around with some of the hidden variables.

All coe files for the BlockRAMs were generated by hand or via the use of small python scripts. All these files and scripts are available in the coe_files directory.
